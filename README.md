# hello-world
nothing is here ;)


when the net fals down 
I'm gona rap to ya

when the generater stops working
i'm gona cry to ya

when the my laptop battery power reaches 0
I'm gonna go to ya

ohhh
listn 
listn
listn listn listn

danceing all night long alone in the dark
people call me crazy , i'm like no I'm just hot
wait dude just hear this the said they gonna fix this shit so hear it is
no net no power yoooo
no rest just prowel yoooo

it's like a jungle out here 
when you talk to someone they make themself look like a bear 
the fact is they eat to much sauce
what the helll man, just stop
you will die if I look at ya , beacue I've eaten lots like ya

walking alone in the dark
hoping my life gets better
syk no it's not
get alone better yeahhh

all the sudden my dad died 
leaving me alone with no might
leaving behind a son a wife in my 19 year old neck with no job
gotta live up strong
build up my self like a brick wall

hoping this night would finally fall, and my life looks like a medow under the shining stars
